# School_District_Analysis

This project aims to perform analysis on the school data using the Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis is to help Maria,a Data Scientist of CitySchool district to analyse the school data collected from various sources and provide insights based on the performance trends and patterns.These insights are useful for taking decisions in school and district level.We need to aggregate the data and see the performance based on the school budgets,size and types.The steps involved in this analysis are done by using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.
Pandas is a python Library used for data manipulation and analysis,It is used with Jupyter Notebook for Reading raw data,Clean and inspect data,Merge datasets,Perform Calculations,Create tables.These tasks are part of Data Wrangling.Data wrangling is used to convey useful information from the data.
For this analysis we need to calculate the district summary,school summary,average reading and math scores in all the grade level,display the top and bottom 5 schools,school peformance based on the budget,school size and type of the school.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis,school board has notified Maria that the file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards.So the school board asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we have replaced the math and reading scores, we would like you to repeat the school district analysis that we did in this module and describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
